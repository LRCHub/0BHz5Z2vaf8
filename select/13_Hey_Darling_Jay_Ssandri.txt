Hey darling, where do you plan to go
She told me I don't know
I've had enough of this city so I'm moving on
Hey darling, what about your family
They don't care about me
They're all caught up in their salaries
I'm sure they won't mind me
I know you're going through a rough patch
Hold your head up don't you dare look back
Another mornings here
Cause life is unfair I'm not sure that you're aware
Hey Darling, how are the unknown pines
Do they move like you thought I'm hoping probably not
Dancing like stones in the wind
Tell me how you've been
Well hey darling I'm going crazy can't you see
Not to have you here with me
I know I'm selfishly pleading
Just never thought you'd leave
I know you're going through a rough patch
Hold your head up won't you dare look back
Another mornings here
Cause life is unfair and I hope that you're aware
And when you fall asleep
And the night begins to weep
Don't be scared
Cause life will fall in place someday
For now darling please just come home
I know you're going through a rough patch
Hold your head up won't you dare look back
And spend a morning here
Cause life is unfair and I'm sure that you're aware
