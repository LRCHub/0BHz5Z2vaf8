Hey Darling
What are you up today
'Cause you look so beautiful

Hey Darling
Where are you going?
It feels unusual

Hey Darling
No no don't you dare
Don't

I keep a stiff upper lip
Before you tell me
Something I'd never believe

Oh my god uh
What you're just doing hurts
Oh my god uh
What you're just doing hurts

You don't know what I've endured
What I've done just for you
Come on baby, baby, baby, please
Oh my god uh - autsch

Hey darling
Always thought you and me
That'd be it

Hey darling
You were my sunshine
My light of the day

My someone forever
Until you showed me your true face

Oh my god uh
What I'm just doing hurts
Oh my god uh
But it is what you deserve

You don't know what I've been through
What I've done just for you
Come on baby baby baby please
Oh my god uh

Uh!
What you're just doing hurts
Oh my god uh
What you're just doing it hurts

It comes out of the blue
Heartlessly and so cruel
Come on baby, baby, baby please
Oh my god
