Hey darling
Have to tell you bout the world
Have to tell you today
Believe me well
Believe me well

You better believe in angels
There's no other substitute
We all do that before we're going up in the sky
If your loving is in your money
No they cannot hug you back
This is the sound of the world
I know, I see, I do, I say

Hey darling
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world?
Hey darling
But all I see is that gonna twist and curl
Take a look around
Take a look around

You're blaming it all on doubt
You must blame it on yourself
You're burning your candle both ways
That I learned from my past
Quench your thirst with mem'ries
There's no point in being stressed
That is the thing I have learned
I've done, I've beat, I seen all that

Hey darling
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world?
Hey darling
But all I see is that gonna twist and curl
Take a look around

Hey darling
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world? (take a look around)
Hey darling
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world? (have to tell you ...)

I'm never gonna change my mind
No I'm never gonna change my mind
Believe me well
Believe me well

Hey darling
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world?
Hey darling
But all I see is that gonna twist and curl (have to tell you ...
Hey darling
Hey darling (have to tell you ...)
Hey darling (ah uh)
Hey darling (have to tel you ...)
Hey darling (believe me well)
